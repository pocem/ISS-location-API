# ISS-location-API
Where in the sky is ISS located right now?

Functionality of the code:

- shows the location of ISS (lat,lon) with the use of API
- tracks down whether the space station is somewhere above you
- tracks down whether it is visible (if it is night at the moment, by using a different API)
- if you keep the program running, you might get an email notifying you that the ISS is somewhere above you at the moment, since it orbits earth about 16 times a day!
